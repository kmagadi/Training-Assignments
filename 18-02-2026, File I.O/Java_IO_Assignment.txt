1) you are given a large application log file (application.log) (Files should be generated first for it)
Using path and files API :
     count total number of INFO, WARN, ERROR
     Extract all errors lines into a new file : error.log
     Generate  a summary file summary.txt like below 
              INFO = 120
              WARN = 15
              ERROR = 8


2) Given a directory path , scan all files recursively.  (put some files in a directory in your system which are randomly created)
       1. Count
                Total files
                Total Directories
                Total File Size
       2. List top 5 largest files 
       3. Generate a report file report.txt
   (Hint: Files.walk(), Files.size(), Path, Comparator.sorting)


3) In a directory, multiple duplicate files may exist.
      1. Detect duplicate files based on :
             Same file size
             Same content(Byte Comparison)
      
4) Given a CSV file:
         id, name, salary
          1, Alice, 50000
          2, Bob, 70000
          3, Charlie, 40000
   
   Calculate average salary, highest salary employee

   Create new file processed.csv with 10% salary increment
